# Wind-Instrument
QMUL University Assessment IDMT Final Project
For this assessment, we were tasked with designing and creating a digital musical instrument, and then performing with it at a Queen Mary University organised show.

The inspiration for this project came from Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and noticing that no one (from what we had seen) had previously attempted a wind-based project in this module.

The wind instrument I created is a granular synthesizer that uses two audio files from Zelda as its input. It features three main controls: one for pitch, one for buffer position, and one for grain size in the granular synthesiser.

Additionally, there are two blow holes, one for bass modulation and one for treble modulation.

The instrument is powered by an Arduino, which connects to a computer via cable. This connection sends data to a Max patch, generating the audio.
